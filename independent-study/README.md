# Code style - comments, syntax, organization, best practices, etc.
## Introduction
Code styles are the rules and conventions developers follow in order to facilitate better collaboration. Following these conventions makes code easier for others to read and understand by setting standards and expectations. Ideally, a project with multiple contributors will appear as though it were written by one developer. If a developer happens to leave a team, a new hire should be able to jump right in, read the code without a problem, and contribute seemlessly. Conversely, the departing team member won't be leaving with any information that remaining team members aren't able to decipher by simply reading the code. This particular consideration is increasingly important given the projected growth within the software development field. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that the field will by 21 percent through 2028. Meaning

In the below examples, both will work. The first however, is a bit easier on the eyes and clearer to understand without the unnessary spaces. It helps the reader easily identify chunks of code that work together. Multiplied by dozens or hundreds of lines of code, it makes a big difference. 
```html
<link rel="stylesheet"  href="styles.css">
```
```html
<link rel = "stylesheet" href = "styles.css">
```

Code styles generally should have no impact on the functionality or performance of the code itself, however proper formatting also ensures that the code will be able to properly interact with other technologies as well as future versions best as possible. 

An early guide to code styles includes the popular "The Elements of Programming Style" by Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger, published in 1974. Their book not only provides suggestions for formatting but also a set of easy to remember and practical lessons for programmers to remember while writing code that others may read. Lessons such as, write clearly -- don't be too clever, make it right before you make it faster, and don't comment bad code -- rewrite it. 

Today, many open source projects have their own specific style guides for developers to follow. This can be very important for large and/or popular projects with thousands of developers either contributing or incorporating code. 













## Google HTML/CSS Style Guide
One such style guide is the  [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide.](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html)



### Personal experience 


- career changer and self taught 
- trouble understanding code of collegues 
- transferable lessons from experience in other fields; journalism, music, etc.

### Brief history and importance 
- examples of bad code
- real world examples from work (carefully picked to preserve sensitve data)
- reference to writings by Robert Pirsig
- reference to The Elements of Programming Style

### Comparisons of styleguides
- Google Style Guides
- standardjs
- airbnb

### What may come in the future
- more career changers
- more collaborators who speak different native (spoken) languages
- programming being a more common skill in the workforce and in general; no longer just geek culture

TODO: delete prior to commit. These notes are to help organize thoughts. 

Focus on HTML/CSS style guides. 

employess often leave or move on to differnt projects. It's important for code to read easily without having to consult with the original author. 

coding is a globally collabartive process. differnt grammar styles in differnt countries so code styles need to be standaradized. 

also important to make sure code is compatible with other languages and future versions. FUTURE PROOF

Talk about debates. i.e. tabs vs. spaces.
