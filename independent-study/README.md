# Code style - comments, syntax, organization, best practices, etc.
## Introduction
Code styles are the rules and conventions developers follow in order to facilitate better collaboration. Following conventions makes code easier for others to read and understand by setting standards and expections. Proper formatting also ensures that the code will be able to properly interact with other technologies as well as future versions best as possible. 

An early guide to code styles includes the popular "The Elements of Programming Style" by Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger, published in 1974. Their book not only provides suggestions for formatting but also a set of easy to remember and practical lessons for programmers to remember while writing code that others may read. Lessons such as, write clearly -- don't be too clever, make it right before you make it faster, and don't comment bad code -- rewrite it. 

Today, many open source projects have their own specific style guides for developers to follow. This can be very important for large and/or popular projects with thousands of developers either contributing or incorporating code.

### Brief history and importance 
- examples of bad code
- real world examples from work (carefully picked to preserve sensitve data)
- reference to writings by Robert Pirsig
- reference to The Elements of Programming Style

### Comparisons of styleguides
- Google Style Guides

- airbnb

### What may come in the future
- more career changers
- more collaborators who speak different native (spoken) languages
