## Notes for instructor
This project presented some difficulties for me due to outside distractions as discussed. I am presenting a minimum viable project and hope to improve upon it after the semester. I'm not much of a designer so forgive me for the lack of flair. I hope to incorporate authentication features which will tie reviews to the usernames. Reviews should also be stored as objects.
